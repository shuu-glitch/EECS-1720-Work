jan 26, 2022
- scrapped my other idea from previous days ; may or may not delete them from my repo entirely.
- came up with the idea of an extension that replaces the images you see when you search something with horror images.
- a walking scopophobia warning , it is.
- uploaded version 1.0 at 2:17pm. it is missing the actual images i created showing for some reason , but it's a start.

jan 27, 2022
- got the images in the extension replacer to show, but encountered two negligible issues that are dated in the updated README.txt file for the project.

- researched discord.py:
	Original Link: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
	Has unfortunately has been officially discontinued on 28th August 2021. Nextcord, a fork of discord.py, will try to replace discord.py, with continued support and features, to still offer former discord.py users a stable API wrapper for their bots. Disnake is recommended as well.

- researched instagram's python API:
	Came across this forum on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61010431/how-to-start-with-the-instagramapi-in-python), which detailed that LevPasha's Instagram-API-python, instabot, and many other API's (like https://github.com/ohld/igbot) are no longer functional as of Oct 24, 2020 after Facebook deprecated the legacy API and now has a new, authentication-required, API. It now requires registering your app with Facebook to be able to get access to many of the API features (via oembed) that were previously available without any authentication.
	This link was from 2021, in April - and includes how to get an API key in the second step: https://rapidapi.com/blog/instagram-api-python/
	This link was updated on Jan. 30th, 2022, and details a python library designed to get access to instagram's API: https://pythonrepo.com/repo/ping-instagram_private_api-python-third-party-apis-wrappers
- researched tiktok's python API (most are unofficial, so i chose one):
	This link was updated on Jan. 31st, 2022 by David Teather: https://pythonrepo.com/repo/davidteather-TikTok-Api-python-third-party-apis-wrappers
	This link talked about how to get and use tiktok's api: https://www.omegatheme.com/blog/110-tiktok-pixel/418-tips-to-get-and-use-tiktok-api-step-by-step
