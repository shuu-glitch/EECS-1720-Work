- finished at 10:55am.

jan 26, 2022
- scrapped my other idea from previous days ; may or may not delete them from my repo entirely.
- came up with the idea of an extension that replaces the images you see when you search something with horror images.
- a walking scopophobia warning , it is.
- uploaded version 1.0 at 2:17pm. it is missing the actual images i created showing for some reason , but it's a start.

jan 27, 2022
- got the images in the extension replacer to show, but encountered two negligible issues that are dated in the updated README.txt file for the project.
- otherwise , it works perfectly fine ! yay.
- updated to version 1.1 of the project at 9:38am.
