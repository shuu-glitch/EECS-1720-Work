Finally, I think I've figured out what I want to go with conceptually. A few of the images were created by me,
and some were edited by me. A few of them are simply stock images.

It's an extension that turns all your images into frightful creatures (but mostly eyes, for now).
Mostly just to remind you that whether your computer or web browser is inanimate or not, someone or something is always watching your every move. :)
Enjoy!

Version 1.0 BUGS:
- The images implemented won't actually SHOW, but at least the images generated by the browser are disappearing. Weird.
