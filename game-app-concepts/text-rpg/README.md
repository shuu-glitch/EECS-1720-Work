### _being-there-together_ (CONCEPT ONLY)
## Text Adventure
- **To get the script to run:** Open the folder, right-click anywhere within the project folder (*where trickery.py is located*), and if you're on Windows, it should say *"Open in Windows Terminal"*. Click that, then enter **python trickery.py** to start the game/script! (For testing purposes exclusively, so far.)
- The game intentionally loops and "breaks" in a certain part; it's a random chance to get the true ending and not die trying to get the requirements to be able to find the answers. :)
