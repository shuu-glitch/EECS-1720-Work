### IDEAS FOR LAB 3:

# IDEA 1:
- A short text adventure game in-browser, that allows you to comment at the end on what ending you got and how you feel about it. Simple but powerful CSS; I wonder if I could use my Twine application to create the HTML for this ... Could also implement a rating system alongside the comment system and display those results, allowing them to be updateable and changed with new reviews.
- **trickery.py** is a test format for this in Python.
- How to make such a thing multiplayer? Or create chat room's mid-game? I have NO real idea, but I might try the comment section thing/review section (similiar to Google reviews or something) afterwards if it doesn't work out - and even then I still don't know how to do that, and have had little lucky figuring out how in a way that isn't in an entirely different language or more complex than my current skill level could ever reach in a matter of a week.

# IDEA 2:
- Quiz website where there are various answers and questions, but some have actual solutions while others don't. I plan to have a display that pops up after an answer for each question is selected (and just before moving onto the next) that shows how many users picked each answer. I also plan to include a review section for the website overall, kind of mixed with a comment section (similiar to Google reviews or something) and display that when the quiz finishes for the users visiting the sight to post their thoughts and discuss; but I don't know how to really keep track of inputs and format it in a way to display it (point to "Would you rather site IMG), nor do I know how to implement the kind of comment/review section I'm looking for without going into stuff other than HTML, CSS, or JS/Python?
- I have an idea of the questions and what I'm going to do with the CSS, but figuring out how to display the information I need to be displayed at certain times has been a pretty fruitless journey.

# IDEA 3:
- Same idea and problems as the above, but the concept is a "Would You Rather?" game with perhaps some moral dilemmas? IDK.
